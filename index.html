		<h4>Video editing 🎥</h4>

		<p>
		Who says travel says memories 💭 And what's the best way to preserve as many moments as possible? In my opinion, it is to make videos of these trips! Indeed, camera in hands and editing software, I don't see the hours passing by 🎞️ 
		I leave you a small sample of my last instagram video, don't hesitate to leave me a little comment to give me your opinion! 😉
